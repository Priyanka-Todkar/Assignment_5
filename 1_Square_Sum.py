# Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum
# In this challenge, you need to implement a method that squares passing variables and returns their sum.
# Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

# Task 1: 👉 Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.
# Task 2: 👉 Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

# Sample properties 1, 3, 5

# Sample method output 35

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def sqSum(self):
        return self.x**2 + self.y**2 + self.z**2

# Example usage:
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
y = int(input("Enter the value of y: "))
z = int(input("Enter the value of z: "))

point = Point(x, y, z)
print(point.sqSum())
